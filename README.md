# Local Library

## About

Local library provides an online catalog for a small local library, where users can browse available books and manage their accounts.

This is a MVC Project that uses the following technologies:

- Pug as the templating engine.
- NodeJS as the runtime.
- Express as the Web Framework.
- MongoDB as the database.
- Mongoose as the ODM.

## Usage

The app is deployed [here](https://local-library-ag.herokuapp.com/catalog)

First a mongo database needs to be setup locally or on Atlas. 
Then one must create a .env file with the key
 MONGO_URL = "..." // enter your connection string.
